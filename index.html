It would be nice if wiki pages could be configured to display at different widths. Looks like they're about ~80% now (which isn't the worst), but I can think of times when I wished I could set them to full width, or at least have them wrap the sidebar on the right once then content descends far enough. I'm thinking of large images or table with a lot of data.

Just a thought.
